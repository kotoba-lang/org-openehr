(ns adl.lexer
  "Shared character-level lexical helpers for the ADL 1.4 grammar: cADL
  (constraint ADL, the `definition` section) and dADL (data ADL, the
  `language`/`description`/`ontology`/`invariant`/`revision_history`/
  `annotations` sections) share one lexical layer -- comments, whitespace,
  identifiers, quoted strings, numbers -- and differ only in what they build
  out of it.

  This is a direct character-index scanner over the whole document, not a
  separate tokenizer pass. ADL's grammar is context-sensitive exactly where
  it matters most: an object's `{...}` body is a list of ATTRIBUTES, but an
  attribute's `{...}` body is a list of OBJECTS-or-primitive-alternatives,
  and which one applies depends on nesting DEPTH, not on any bounded
  lookahead over a token stream. A pre-cut token vector would just make the
  caller reconstruct the source-position bookkeeping a plain string index
  already carries for free -- so this mirrors kotoba-lang/xml's xml.parse
  and this workspace's other wire-format codecs (org-dnp3, org-modbus):
  every function here is `[s i] -> [value next-index]` (or throws
  `ex-info` with an `:adl/error` key, which every public entry point in
  adl.dadl/adl.cadl/adl.archetype/adl.path catches and turns into a named
  `[:error ...]` result -- see those namespaces for why `throw` never
  escapes a public function).

  Char classification here uses `re-matches` against a length-1 string
  rather than `(int c)` range comparisons or `Character/isLetter`-style
  interop: ADL identifiers are pure ASCII, and per this workspace's own
  incident history, `(int c)` on a character silently returns 0 under
  ClojureScript (a JVM `char`'s numeric coercion does not carry over) --
  the exact class of bug this library's dual-runtime verification exists
  to catch. A regex against a 1-character string is slower per-char but
  behaves identically on both runtimes, and these documents are a few
  hundred lines, not a hot loop."

  Every PUBLIC parse entry point (adl.dadl/parse-value, adl.cadl/parse-object,

  this back into a plain `[:error kw detail]` return value -- callers of a
  parser never see an exception, only a tagged result, per this workspace's
  \"named errors, not throw\" rule. `throw`/`catch` stays purely an internal
  control-flow shortcut between here and that one boundary."
